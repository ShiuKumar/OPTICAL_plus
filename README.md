# OPTICAL_plus
OPTICAL_plus predictor 
This is a Matlab based predictor and requires Matlab 2018a or latest Matlab version that supports LSTM networks. The following m-files: CSP.m, LDA.m, get_optimized_par.m, fitnessFunctionLSTM_par.m and TournamentSelection.m needs to be in the same folder as the OPTICAL_plus.m file or can be added to your Matlab path. The example_code.m file can be used to see the OPTICAL predictor being trained and used to predict the output class using the sample data (sample_data.mat and Actual_class.mat files) which can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hdr7v2art9mz1px/AAAoF9Z1qQsnl3_dSiZtLoi1a?dl=0. Alternatively, download all the files at the given link and run the example_code.m file.

The code can be used for research purpose only. Any work resulting from the use of this code should cite our original paper "OPTICAL+: A Frequency-Based Deep Learning Scheme for Recognizing Brain Wave Signals" that is currently under review in PeerJ Computer Science.
